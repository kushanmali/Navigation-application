We have developed a solution that simplifies GPS tracking and provides an easy-to-use interface for users. Our system consists of an IoT unit that detects the user's current location and a web application. The IoT unit uses GPS technology to determine the user's coordinates, which are then displayed. The web application allows users to select their desired destination and provides navigation instructions. By integrating the IoT unit and web application, we have created a user-friendly system that makes GPS navigation easier and more accessible for everyone.
